# Ethereum Transaction Data Pipeline Project
## Introduction
This is a leanr-as-you-go project aimed at learning data engineering technologies and practices. The overarching aim is to tap ino a source - The Ethereum Blockchain Network - and deliver the data to a consumer - Tableau or any other front-end equivalent.
The project is meant to be expansive, where deploying most optimal solution is not necessarily top of the priority, but learning how to definitely is.
The project timeline will be in phases and the project structure fluid.
